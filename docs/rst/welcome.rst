DreamMaker FX is an audio effects platform that is designed to help musicians easily invent and perform through novel effects that have never been heard before.  

DreamMaker FX is build around the Arduino platform making it easy to create and control complex effects.  However, unlike other Arduino-based effects platforms, audio processing on DreamMaker FX is done on a powerful SHARC DSP.  SHARC DSPs are specialized audio processors used in lots of high-end audio gear.
